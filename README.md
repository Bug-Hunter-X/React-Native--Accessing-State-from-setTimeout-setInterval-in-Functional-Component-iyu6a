This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native when using functional components: accessing state variables from within `setTimeout` or `setInterval` callbacks.  The problem arises because these callbacks might execute after the component has unmounted, leading to errors.  The solution involves using useRef and useEffect hooks for proper state management and cleanup.
